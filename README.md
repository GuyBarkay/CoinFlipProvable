# CoinFlipProvable
CoinFlipDAppApprovable Exercise

This DApp2 was created as part of a mission in the "Ethereum Smart Contract Programming Course". https://academy.ivanontech.com/.

This is a FlipCoin Dapp. In order to make the Dapp a little bit more challenging, the player has the privilege to accumulate his own winning sums balances and to keep them in the Dapp address, as a separate untouchable balance/vault, until he will decide to withdraw it.
