# CoinFlipProvable
CoinFlipDAppApprovable Exercise

This DApp was created as part of a mission in the "Ethereum Smart Contract Programming Course". https://academy.ivanontech.com/.

This is a FlipCoin Dapp, using oracle in order to get off-chain random data (by using provable in truffle). In addition, the code enables the player to accumulate his own winning sums balances and to keep them in the smart contract address, as a separate untouchable balance/vault, until he will decide to withdraw it
