# CoinFlipProvable
CoinFlipDAppApprovable Exercise

This DApp was created as part of a mission in the "Ethereum Smart Contract Programming Course 201". https://academy.ivanontech.com/.

This is a FlipCoin Dapp code, using oracle to get off-chain random data (using "provable" in "truffle"). The code enables the player to gamble on a coin (50% 50%) and to accumulate his winning sums balances, in a separate untouchable balance /vault, until he will decide to withdraw it to his wallet address.
